        <p class="text-justify awareMrgTop">WHO recommends that almost 10 percent of your diet, or 200 calories in a daily intake of
            2000 calories, can be sugar. You might say, “Oh, that’s a lot! I only have two tablespoons in my tea/coffee
            and maybe a couple more in my juice/soft drinks,” right?
            That’s because you are unaware of the sugar added in the packages of food you eat everyday!
            Don’t believe us? Calculate the numbers for yourself.
            Here’s a simple DIY exercise:
        </p>
        <ul class="blogOl browser-default">
            <li>Food diary - write down all the food items and approx quantity you consume everyday for at least three days.</li>
            <li>Write down the known amount of added sugar wherever possible - for example two teaspoons in your morning coffee etc.</li>
            <li>Exclude natural sugar sources like fruits and vegetables from the list.</li>
            <li>Read the labels on the back of packaged food and write the serving amount you have consumed. For example, one tablespoon of ketchup.</li>

                <p class="text-justify">When you turn the package around, you will see some basic signs. In India, there
                    is an FSSAI seal which means it has gone through the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India,
                    and has a license number. Additionally, you will see a green or red dot which shows it is vegetarian
                    or non-vegetarian.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">It may also have the symbol of +F which denotes that it has been “fortified”
                    with nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Our daily staples like rice, wheat, milk, salt, sugar
                    and oil, when fortified, can help us develop muscle strength, immunity and better health.</p>

            <div class="col s12">
            <p class="text-justify">The basics of course are also to check the expiry date, storage instructions, as
                    well as items in the ingredients list that may aggravate any existing allergies, especially if you
                    or someone in your family already suffers from them.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you see the two labels above they state the ingredients and nutrition facts
                    at the back of a commonly used product in our homes - ketchup. Ketchup is the accompaniment for many
                    snacks, and sometimes we eat it liberally without knowing its true contents. It has a nice tangy
                    tomato flavour that makes anything taste good! But what about the health quotient of ketchup? For
                    that we have to check the nutrition facts behind the bottle or pouch that you buy.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m4">
                <img src="images/Lady.png" class="responsive-img" alt="hyperactive">
            </div>
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">The first thing to notice is the net weight, which in the case of this pouch was
                    950 g. Once you know the net weight, you can then calculate the calories per serving. In this
                    product, the nutrient values are calculated on the basis of every 100 g serving. This does not mean
                    you consume one full serving, it is just for ease of calculating the approximate value of the
                    nutrients per serving and the calorie content. Your consumption totally depends on how much you
                    need.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The nutrition facts are for approximately 1/9th of the packet contents. Some
                    brands may give you the nutritional value for the full contents as well, i.e. the entire 950 g.
                    Next is to check the number of calories. In the label above, the packet clearly states 133.52 kcals
                    per 100 g of ketchup. (Note: kcal and cal are used interchangeably in nutrition and denote the same
                    value). “Energy” is often the word used for calorie content. So, in this case, when you consume one
                    serving of 100 g of ketchup you’ve essentially consumed almost 5% your daily calorie quota for the
                    day. </p>

        <h2 class="Futura-Bold center">What is % DV</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12">
                <p class="text-justify">Another important value on all food labels is the %DV or the percent daily value
                    which essentially denotes the percentage of nutrients you receive per serving in relation to 2000
                    calories, which is considered a standard number of calories needed by an adult on a daily basis, in
                    most countries.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">But this value can change depending on one’s height, weight, sex, age or health
                    concerns. You may need less or more than 2000 calories, depending on your health goals. You can
                    consult a dietician to determine the ideal amount needed for you.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The important values to check in this section are total fat, total
                    carbohydrates, sugars, or added sugars if mentioned separately, saturated fats, trans fats and
                    sodium. To control obesity, diabetes, cholesterol and high BP, it is important that these levels are
                    low. A saturated fat value of under 2.0% is a relatively healthy option. In this case, the total fat
                    content is 0.28 g which is not so bad, as the ideal fat content in a day for an adult should be
                    between 20-35 % or 44 - 77 g.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">But, carbohydrates again denote sugars and more calories. Here it is 31.32 g per
                    serving, which if converted is approximately 242 calories, again one tenth of your daily calorie
                    intake. </p>

        <h2 class="Futura-Bold center">How To Calculate The Sugar Content </h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">The sugar content in the ketchup here is 23.45 g which roughly converts to
                    179.42 kcal for every 100g. and, if your daily consumption has to be approx 200 cal, most of it has
                    been consumed in the 100 g serving of ketchup.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">WHO states that if your daily calorie intake is 2000, then sugars should
                    contribute not more than 10% which is approx 200 calories. You will also consume sugar throughout
                    the day in different forms like carbohydrates, natural sugars found in fruits and milk, as well as
                    added sugars found in packaged forms. (Source - WHO calls on countries to reduce sugars intake among
                    adults and children). In the case of ketchup then, consuming it means stopping there and not
                    consuming anything else!</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col s12 m4">

            </div>
            <div class="col s12">
            <p class="text-justify">The other values that should be high in a nutrition fact sheet are, fibre,
                    protein, Vitamin, A, B, C & D as well as calcium and iron. Here protein is 1.43 g which is good, but
                    all the other nutrients are missing. So, in a sense ketchup could be looked at as something with
                    empty calories, because, besides taste, it does not benefit the body in any other way. That’s
                    probably why a lot of Indians used to make ketchups at home, or also substitute it with healthy
                    coriander or coconut chutneys.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">In most packages sugar may not be divided as per natural sugars and added
                    sugars. If a term like “Total Sugars” or just “Sugars” is used, it essentially means nutrients from
                    sugar found in natural foods like milk, fruits etc, and any other added sugars.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">When the package states, “Added sugars” it means sugars found in processed forms
                    like sucrose or dextrose. Most countries don’t state “natural sugars” on their food labels, as there
                    is no dietary recommendation for the same, because they are natural and the body digests them easily
                    with little harm.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">Find out how much sugar is in your food by doing these simple checks:</p>
                <ul class="text-justify blogOl browser-default">
                    <li>Look at the 'carbs as sugars' on the nutrition panel. This includes both natural and added
                        sugars. Less than 5g per 100g is considered low, more than 22.5g per 100g is high.</li>
                    <li>Check the ingredients list – any items ending in 'ose' (glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose,
                        maltose) are all forms of sugar, as are honey, agave, molasses and syrups like corn and rice
                        syrup. The higher up the ingredient list these are, the more sugar the product contains.</li>
                    <li>Manufacturers are increasingly using what they describe as more ‘natural’ sugars like coconut
                        sugar. These are still ‘free’ sugars and carry the same health risks, despite the healthy
                        perception.</li>
                    <li>Know your substitutes. Xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol occur naturally in small amounts in plants
                        and fruits and are often used in low-calorie products to provide sweetness, but with fewer
                        calories.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="col s12">
            <p class="text-justify">(As per our research, Stevia is the best natural sweetener available out there,
                    and plant based additives like Erythritol, lactose work the best and are safe too)</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The lower the added sugar intake in a day, the better one’s health… Excessive
                    sugar, when broken down, gets stored in the body as fat, puts a load on the organs, and uses more
                    insulin from the pancreas to get converted into energy. Excessive added sugar causes blood sugar
                    spikes that may eventually lead to diabetes and obesity, if not burned with enough exercise.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Thus, controlling the quantities of sugar we eat and trying to count the
                    calories that we get from sugar become imperative in maintaining good health, fitness and longevity.
