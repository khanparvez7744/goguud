          <p class="text-justify">The overarching vision is to do ‘guud’ for society, by transforming their food and beverage choices with healthier and more
natural options.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">We keep a healthy person healthy by bringing together the
ancient Indian wisdom of Ayurveda with modern science, and
delivering fully natural and healthy products that are both tasty
and nutritious.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">By replacing the one everyday item that we consume so
frequently, and sometimes in rather large quantities, we can
make giant leaps in the direction of health and vitality.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The Group believes that with growing levels of diabetes, obesity, and other related diseases, the way Indians eat and drink
needs intervention.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">With this in mind, the Group tapped into the ancient Indian
wisdom of Ayurveda and combined it with new-age scientific
research to develop a brand of products called Guud. This
range of sugars and sweeteners can benefit people nutritionally
and still add flavor to their food and drink.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The ultimate goal is to build a world-class health and wellness
company that keeps research and innovation at the forefront of
its initiatives, as it touches the lives of millions of consumers in
India and across the world.

        <h1 class="Futura-Bold">Mission</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">Guud was born out of the Ayurvedic philosophy स्वस्थस्य स्वास्थ्य
रक्षणं, which literally translates into 'protecting the health of the
healthy’.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">In confluence with Ayurveda experts, doctors and food technologists, our range of products infused with sugar and natural
herbs, help manage and mitigate issues related to a sedentary
lifestyle and excessive sugar consumption.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Our line of GUUD products is aligned with our vision – To do
guud by helping people live better and healthier lives.
</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Guud is more than a business; it’s one small step in the direction of wellness.</p>

<p class="text-justify">The “Guud” line of products completely changes the perception
of sugar, as it helps people enjoy sweetness, albeit with health
benefits. Sugar needn’t always be “bad”, now it can be “guud”!</p>
<p class="text-justify">The range of Guud sugar brings to the consumer a collection of
packaged sugar and sugar substitutes that blend the sweetness
of sugar with the wellness of natural herbs. These raw sugars
fortified with Ayurvedic herbs, vitamins & minerals, give the
same sweetness in half the serving.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Essentially, adding more health to the healthy, and more sweetness to everyone’s life!</p>
