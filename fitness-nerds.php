                    sweet tooth. Just make it harder to get. Craving for an
                    ice-cream after lunch today? Run an extra mile or simply
                    take the stairs instead of the elevator. Make both your
                    body and mind work to get that sweet treat. These
                    trade-offs also help you to cut down on impulse by delaying gratification. Many times, the sense of
                    achievement
                    replaces the craving so that you move on from it. The
                    feeling of happiness after cleaning up the garage can take
                    over the need to gorge on that gulab jamun.</p>

                <p class="text-justify fitnessMrg">If it’s really hard to resist the sugary stuff, go for it, but mix
                    it with something that’s good for your health. There are
                    many fiber, vitamin or mineral rich foods that don’t taste
                    that good but are essential for a runner. Bring these two
                    together and you are up for a healthy and tasty treat.
                    Dilute cranberry juice with electrolyte water, mix hot cocoa
                    with banana shake, dunk a scoop of ice cream into a bowl
                    of dry nuts or spread some shredded wheat on your
                    honey-coated granola. These quick hacks help lower the
                    overall sugar content without making you compromise on
                    the sweet treat. </p>

                <p class="text-justify fitnessMrg">As an athlete, you need to be mindful of your nutrition as
                    well as calorie intake. This is no way to suggest that you
                    compromise on your sweet favourites. All you need to do
                    is take care of the amount of intake. After all, moderation
                    is always the key. Be conscious of the amount of ice-cream
                    you scoop-off or limit your bite on the birthday cake. Also,
                    be sure to read the labels of any food. Usually, the packaging contains more than one serving.
                    Easier said than
                    done, try and keep the stashes of indulgence out of reach
                    so that you don’t always reach out for the second
                    helpings, or the third.

                <p class="text-justify fitnessMrg">During workout, runners come across two windows when
                    the sugar levels of their bodies naturally go down. And
                    that’s a good thing. These two windows offer them not just
                    excuses but also reasons to feed themselves up with sugar.
                    During and post workout, an athlete’s body metabolises
                    sugar for fuel and refills glycogen levels in the body as a
                    measure for recovery. Therefore, drink or eat your choice
                    of sugar during this time. However, be mindful of the type,
                    quality and portion. What about the other times? Well,
                    one should be aware that once the glycogen level of the
                    body is full, the sugar you consume straight away
                    becomes stored fat. Hence, if you really like to drink up
                    that glass of chocolate shake or can’t resist biting on those
                    doughnuts, time it within 30 minutes of finishing a workout. </p>

                <p class="text-justify fitnessMrg">It’s a common practice amongst athletes to rely on energy
                    gels or bars for quick intake of energy. While it’s easy and
                    serves the purpose for the moment, in the long run it may
                    still contribute to sugar dependency. Another way to
                    replenish while on the run is to replace those packaged
                    gels with natural, home-made alternatives. Easily
                    prepared foods like baked and mashed sweet potato with
                    a sprinkle of black salt, banana nut sandwich, dried fruits
                    like dates and raisins or even homemade carrot-and-ginger cake can be good options. They bring you
                    the essential
                    sugar while providing all the energy you need.</p>

                <p class="text-justify fitnessMrg">While the requirement of quick and easy sugar intakes
                    during and post workout remains, a better way to cut that
                    usage down is to increase energy-giving food in your base
                    meals. Include nutrient-dense carbohydrates like whole
                    grains (bread, pasta, rice, quinoa), beans/pulses,
                    potatoes/sweet potatoes, oats, dairy, fruits and vegetables
                    in your daily meals. A regular practice of a balanced diet
                    prevents blood sugar fluctuations, preventing irregular
                    sugar cravings. Do try and include different food groups
                    into your meals. Bananas with nut butter, chicken with
                    avocado and wheat bread, sweet potato and cheese,
                    yoghurt and fruit are combinations that keep your blood
                    sugar levels in check.</p>
