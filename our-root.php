          <p class="text-justify">A movement that started 66 years ago has today turned into a
legend. On March 7th, 1956, when the first edition of the
Rajasthan Patrika rolled out, it was the first local newspaper
that spoke of its people and stood for high moral values and
credibility. Over the years, the search for truth and the mission
of social welfare echoed across other mediums like TV, radio
and digital. Today, the Patrika group is not just one of the most
read, heard or viewed news houses but also a loved and
respected name across India.</p>
