                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Does GUUD sugar have taste like Kadha (Indian herbal concoction), as it
has so many herbs?
</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Despite all its natural herbs and nutrients, GUUD sugar tastes exactly like regular
sugar.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Does GUUD Stevia have a bitter aftertaste?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>No, GUUD Stevia, from our range of sweeteners, has no aftertaste whatsoever.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>How do I decide which Guud sugar is for me?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>GUUD sugars come under three broad categories – 1) Everyday Wellness for regular
daily use, 2) diabetic’s corner for those suffering from diabetes and 3) fitness pal, for
those who are looking to stay slim or lose some calories. Depending on what your
requirement is you can choose accordingly.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Can I mix two different types of Guud sugars?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Ideally, it’s best to stick to one kind of sugar in one beverage or food item, but there
is no harming in mixing too, as all our sugars are natural and healthier.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Why not use natural alternatives like Gur/palm sugar/dates sugar etc?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, there is no harm in using those too, but sometimes for daily cooking, a regular
sugar is more appropriate, and this is one of the healthier versions of regular refined
sugar as it is enriched with nutrients and low in calories.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is it safe for children?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Of course, all GUUD sugars are safe for all age groups, from children to grandparents</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Why does this sugar have a golden hue?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>This sugar has a golden colour because it is not the typical white refined sugar that
you get in the market. It has been customised for different purposes and incorporates herbs and natural sweeteners that give it the golden hue.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Will the golden hue change the colour of the dish we are cooking/baking?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>No, it will simply get absorbed in what you’re making and take on the colour of the
dish.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Can one have allergic reactions to these sugars as some plant extracts may
not suit some people?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It is very rare for anyone to have allergic reactions to these plant extracts, unless they
have a history of it. In case, you do notice anything on your body after consuming
GUUD sugars, you can stop using them immediately and consult your doctor. But,
the minute quantities of plant extracts used in these sugars, are unlikely to cause
allergies to anyone. </span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is there any long term damage to the body while consuming sweeteners?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>GUUD sweeteners are totally safe for consumption and will not have any adverse
effects on your health in the long or short term. Because of the natural ingredients
in our products, in fact, GUUD sweeteners are beneficial and avoid one from putting
on weight, and experiencing sugar spikes.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>How do we know if GUUD has got spoiled and crossed its expiry date?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>If GUUD sugars kept in a cool and dry place, they will not get spoiled for at least a
year. Like regular sugar, only if it gets wet, and is stored that way for a long time, it
may accumulate fungus. If consumed regularly with dry spoons you will not face this
problem.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Why is it not organic?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It is not organic because the manufacturing process requires us to use some binding
agents along with the base sugar S3 which is also processed. However, it is sulphur
free.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is it sulphur free?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, it is devoid of any traces of sulphur.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Why is it so expensive?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It is slightly more expensive than regular sugars, because we have developed them
by incorporating natural herbs and superior quality ingredients, along with R&D that
is specific to GUUD.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>When should one avoid using these sugars? (Contraindications)?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It can be avoided when sugar levels are too high, as you want to stay away from all
forms of sugar then. But otherwise there are no contraindications for those in good
health.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>How can we add it to Indian desserts or bake with it?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>This can be done in the same way that you use normal sugar. Simply follow your
recipe, and add the chosen GUUD sugar at the right step in the recipe.
</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is it vegan?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, it is, as the herbs are plant extracts.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is it gluten free? </div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, it is gluten free, so if someone suffers from gluten intolerance they needn’t

                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, we have tried to stay as compliant to environment-friendly and moral paths
while developing GUUD sugar. Rest assured all our practices are ethical and safe.
</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Do I need the same amount as regular sugar, or is it sweeter?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It is much sweeter with just half the amount. So if you were using two teaspoons in
your tea, you can now cut it down to just one teaspoon.</span></div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Can we add it to green tea?
</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Yes, of course, if you like your green tea a little sweet, you can add it. Just like honey,
it adds the same kind of sweetness with much fewer calories.</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>How can you prove your claims? Is there a litmus test?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Our sugars have undergone several food regulation tests, some of them are ______
xyz. (need to add the relevant certifications here, if we have else will remove this)</span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is your packaging environment-friendly? Can it be reused-recycledreturned?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>It is environment-friendly and can be reused to store other household items. </span></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>What are the extracts and other ingredients in GUUD stevia?

                    <div class="collapsible-header Futura-Bold"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i>Is there a limit as to how much GUUDsugar one must consume?
</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body text-justify"><span>Just like any sugar, GUUD too must be consumed in moderation, and as WHO says,
it should constitute less than 10 percent of your total calorie intake. The advantage
of GUUD is that since the sugars are a little lower in calories and with the same
amount of sweetness, even if you consume a little extra one day, you will still be well
within your calorie limit!</span></div>
