            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">Without going into much of chemistry, let’s understand
                    that sugar is a biological molecule consisting of carbon,
                    hydrogen and oxygen atoms. As we consume these molecules, the body breaks them down to form energy.
                    To put
                    it simply, the more sugar we consume, the tougher it
                    becomes for the body to work them out. Or in other
                    words, eating sugar in moderation is absolutely fine for a
                    healthy body.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Generally, we receive sugars from two sources - natural or
                    added. The former is found naturally in fruits and vegetables that we consume and the later comes in
                    crystals,
                    cubes or in similar forms.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Globally, sugar is made from either sugarcane or sugar
                    beet. Around 80% of sugar around the world is extracted
                    from sugarcane, while the remaining 20% is made from
                    sugar beet. In India, sugar is extracted from sugarcane. </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">Research done on animals has shown that sugar has a
                    drug-like effect. However, we humans don’t consume
                    sugar in isolation or to prove any assumption in a laboratory. Sugar is an integral part of our
                    diet. Consumed in
                    mindfulness, it adds to our delicacy, without making it
                    addictive or harmful.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">A research done in Cardiff University’s School of Psychology* reveals
                    addiction-like behaviour towards sugar and
                    other foods is only present in a minority of obese individuals. However, sugar can drive
                    overconsumption of foods.
                    Hence, one should be wary of it. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">This is probably the most popular myth, which even has an
                    interesting coinage – sugar rush, especially in children.
                    Years of research has discovered that there is no scientific
                    evidence to back this claim. It is a psychological effect of
                    sugar-induced drinks that gives you a feel-good factor.
                    Another important factor leading to this belief is the popular marketing campaigns that offer
                    sugar-sweetened
                    drinks as a quick fix to boost mood and combat fatigue.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">Another common myth is that sugar is a direct cause for
                    diabetes. However, modern research has shown that
                    contrary to popular belief, there is no direct link between
                    the two.* The reason for this confusion is an inherent
                    association between blood sugar levels and diabetes.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Genetics and lifestyle are the two biggest causes for
                    diabetes. If one is genetically inclined to diabetes or leads
                    an unhealthy lifestyle including not exercising or smoking/drinking, resulting in being overweight,
                    there is a
                    greater chance of developing diabetes. Uncontrolled
                    consumption of sugar can only act as a catalyst. It all leads
                    to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, and not just
                    consumption of sugar, which is key to inducing, controlling
                    or reversing of diabetes.</p>

            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">One blanket argument is that cancer cells require energy
                    to survive and divide, which sugar can provide. This
                    perhaps is the cause for this myth. However, all cells need
                    sugar and other nutrients like fats and amino acids. So, it’s
                    unfair to put sugar under the guillotine.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Scientists are busy with ongoing research to find out links
                    between sugar consumption and cancer. *Studies lead us
                    to overweight and obesity as the key reasons for cancer as
                    well, thereby bringing sugar into the conversation. However, for now, the association is no more
                    than a rumour.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">The jury is still out on this subject, however the presence of
                    chemicals doesn’t really make them a promising alternative. Berkeley University author Michael
                    Pollan puts it
                    succinctly, “If it’s a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant,
                    don’t.”*</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Overall, cutting down on added sugar in our diets is a
                    healthy practice. However, don’t compromise on the
                    naturally occurring sugar found in fruits, vegetables and
                    complex carbohydrates. Just keep a check on the overall

            <div class="col s12 m8">
                <p class="text-justify">Fruits taste good, primarily because they are sweet. This is
                    also a key reason why people keep them off their plates.
                    The belief that the sugar content in fruit can add to body
                    weight is absolutely wrong.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Fruits contain a range of healthy compounds, including a
                    variety of vitamins, minerals and fibre, together inducing a
                    sweet taste. Particularly sweet fruits like mango and
                    blueberries have been found to provide a positive effect
                    on fasting blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Similarly,
                    dairy products and complex carbohydrates peas, beans,
                    whole grains and green vegetables aid in healthy bodily
                    functions. While moderation is again the keyword, removing fruits from our diet will be a mistake.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">A good way to tackle this is to replace sugar with jaggery
                    or sugar from other sources like date and coconut. The
                    alternatives are more natural and have the same amount
                    of calories.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">One argument we all agree on is that excess sugar is bad
                    for health. Therefore, it makes sense to reduce its intake.
                    This is definitely true for carbonated drinks or processed
                    food like ice cream. However, to remove sugar completely, is definitely not a worthy way ahead.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Natural sugar from fruits, for instance, is a good sugar to
                    consume. There is no reason one should keep it out of
                    one’s diet. As for other forms of sugar, there are a few
                    options available in the market which can be a good alternative.</p>
