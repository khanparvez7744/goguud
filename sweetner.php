            <p class="text-justify">These are times when health and fitness override any other priority. What
                we eat, how it is made, and with what ingredients –
                organic and local or artificial and processed – are all factored in
                when we make our choices as consumers.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">All white foods have automatically become villains, the biggest
                among them being sugar. A high sugar diet is said to have detrimental effects on out health and fitness.
                It can cause high blood
                pressure, weight gain, cavities among many other issues.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">But Guud sugar is here to change that notion... Sugar is not all
                bad, it can have health benefits too, especially when it is blended
                with natural ingredients that aid digestion, manage glucose
                levels as well as lower your glycemic index (GI). </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Everyday Wellness is our range of sugars that can be used by the
                entire family – from grandparents to grandchildren. The entire
                family can benefit from its natural low calorie properties that
                enhance health and vitality.</p>
