        <h3>This brings us to the most basic question –
            What exactly is diabetes, and why is it such
            a debilitating disease?</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the
                    pancreas make little or no insulin (an important hormone),
                    and/or, when the insulin produced is not used effectively
                    by the body to extract sugar (glucose) from food, and
                    convert it into energy.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This essentially means that both functions - regular levels
                    of insulin production, and the body’s ability to effectively
                    use that insulin - are essential to conduct our daily activities with vigour and vitality.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Needless to say, when either of these two functions fail,
                    glucose levels build up, energy levels fall, we feel more
                    thirsty or hungry, and urinate often, among other symptoms. In the long run, the body could also
                    become more
                    prone to infections and there could be organ damage.

                    insulin needs to be injected into the body every day to
                    enable healthy living. This type of diabetes could develop

                    often take care of this type of diabetes, but some diabetics

            </div>
            <div class="col s12 m8" data-aos="flip-left">
                <p class="text-justify">While Type 1 diabetes is largely genetic, Type 2 is often a
                    result of one’s lifestyle and diet, of which sugar consumption plays a big role. In fact, research
                    states that countries
                    with the highest consumption of sugar have the highest
                    number of diabetics and vice verse.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Something as simple as the daily consumption of sweetened beverages, can
                    increase the risk of diabetes by 25%,
                    and also add plenty of empty calories to your day.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The risk of diabetes due to added sugars probably increases because of the load
                    that fructose puts on the liver, if it
                    does not get utilised by the body’s cells. The excessive
                    sugar intake also makes the pancreas produce more
                    insulin than needed, ultimately leading to Type 2 diabetes.
                    To add to it, excessive sugar consumption leads to weight
                    gain and a fatty liver, both of which make one more prone
                    to diabetes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="s12 m12">
                <p class="text-justify">The same is not true about natural sugars though, those
                        found in fruits and vegetables, where no sugar is added in
                        the manufacturing process. This is largely because natural
                        sugars are found in combination with fibre, water, nutrients and antioxidants, and therefore take
                        longer to get
                        digested and absorbed by the body. This reduces the
                        probability of blood sugar spikes.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Thus, the sugars one chooses – either artificial or natural,
                        contribute in a big way to how prone one is to getting Type
                        2 diabetes. We would love to be able to only eat natural
                        sugars, but it is only natural to crave the regular white
                        sugar too. In this case, it would be wise to study the
                        market and find the “lesser evil”.

                <p class="text-justify">Your diet is made up of the complete spectrum of foods
                    that you consume on a regular basis. To manage and treat
                    diabetes better, one has to constantly monitor what one
                    consumes and in what quantities. It’s not just the food
                    itself, but the food habits too that ensure a balanced

                <ul class="blogOl browser-default">

                        enables a more accurate intake of the insulin doses
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Include high fibre, complex carbohydrates, and low

                        whole grains, pulses etc</li>
                    <li>Low fat milk and yoghurt can be added to your diet.</li>
                    <li>Eat fruit, dates and nuts, honey, lemon water or a

                <p class="text-justify">When working out, the muscle cells use up glucose for
                    energy, even when there is a limited amount of insulin or

                    <li>While exercising, stay in touch with your body to
                        understand if sugar levels are fluctuating. Eating a
                        healthy snack like fruits or nuts helps maintain sugar

                    </li>
                    <li>If too tired while exercising, take some time to relax,
                        sip on lime water, eat something sweet like a biscuit or
                        candy, and resume at a later point.</li>

                <ul class="blogOl browser-default">
                    <li>Cultivate hobbies that relax you. Listening to soothing
                        music or playing board games can take your mind off
                        stressful thoughts.</li>
                    <li>Inculcate deep breathing practices from yoga that can
                        regulate your heart rate when anxious.</li>

                <li>Include aerobic activity of any kind, like swimming,
                            cycling, yoga, or brisk walking, as they are stress
                            busters.</li>
                <li>Take up meditation practices like chanting or praying
                    to help erase negative thoughts, and surrender your
                    worries to a larger force.</li>
