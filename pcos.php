            <div class="col s12 m8" data-aos="flip-left">
                <p class="text-justify">One may have to completely change one’s lifestyle and
                    dietary habits to reduce its harmful effects, and lead a
                    healthier life. Undoubtedly, managing insulin levels is a
                    primary concern in PCOS, as excessive insulin production
                    leads to excessive androgen production, which eventually
                    leads to the formation of cysts in the ovary.

                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">So, it becomes important for women suffering from PCOS
                    to manage insulin levels, obesity or being overweight,
                    which makes diet a critical component of PCOS management. Not just diet, more importantly one’s
                    sugar intake
                    also plays a key role, as excessive added sugars in foods
                    lead to blood sugar spikes. Blood sugar spikes are caused
                    by high carbohydrate and low-fibre diets or high GI diets
                    that get digested easily by the body and again lead to
                    blood sugar spikes.</p>

            <div class="col s12 m8" data-aos="flip-left">
                <p class="text-justify">Undoubtedly, to manage PCOS, one needs to manage
                    weight gain, and insulin levels. This requires a diet of
                    foods that have a low glycemic index or GI. These foods
                    take a long time to get digested by the body and thereby
                    reduce blood sugar spikes, one of the main reasons for
                    PCOS and Type 2 diabetes. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Therefore, women with PCOS have to particularly pay
                    attention to their food choices. They should include high
                    fibre fruits and vegetables like apples, plums, broccoli,
                    Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, beans, lentils, avocado, green
                    and red peppers, almonds, berries, sweet potatoes,
                    squash and pumpkin.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Additionally, lean proteins like fish, tofu and chicken -
                    though not rich in fibre - help reduce one’s appetite as you
                    feel satiated faster.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Anti-inflammatory foods also reduce the effects of PCOS.
                    Foods rich in these properties are spinach, kale, tomatoes,
                    almonds and walnuts, berries of different kinds, fresh
                    herbs and spices like turmeric, cinnamon and ginger.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The role of healthy eating is an integral part of controlling
                    the effects of PCOS. Healthier dietary choices and eating
                    patterns help lose weight, and thereby help one deal with
                    PCOS better.

                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Added sugars or refined white sugars that are found in
                    packaged and processed food are the main culprits of
                    weight gain. These are called added sugars because they
                    are not naturally found in fruits and vegetables. Natural
                    sugars are better as they get digested slowly, while added
                    sugars get digested quickly, and make you crave for more.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Moreover, added sugars are devoid of vitamins, minerals,
                    protein, fat, and fibre, and thus referred to as empty
                    calories. They also make you gain more body fat at an
                    accelerated rate.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Prolonged consumption of high quantities of sugar leads
                    to high blood sugar levels, which lead to a condition called
                    hyperglycemia - a result of insulin resistance in the body.
                    Hyperglycemia is also responsible for weight gain, an
                    important cause of PCOS.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">As per WHO sugar should only constitute 10 percent of
                    your diet. In a daily intake of 2000 calories, that’s approximately 200 calories.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">If this can be further reduced – as is the case with many of
                    GUUD’s sugars, that have the same amount of sweetness
                    with half the calories – then, the amount of calories
                    consumed reduces each day by half i.e. only 100 calories.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">What’s more, many of our sugar varieties are enriched
                    with fibre herbs, vitamins and minerals that ensure you
                    are not consuming “empty” calories. In fact, you are
                    fortifying the body, and boosting immunity. You can check
                    out our vast range of GUUD products here.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">These sugars can not only be added to your beverages
                    and foods, but you can also use them to make healthy
                    desserts made from whole wheat, oats, almond or coconut
                    milk, combined with nuts and dry fruits to make them tasty

                    foods, and the right minerals and
                    vitamins, one also needs to incorporate a daily regime of
                    exercise.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">This could include at least 30 minutes of an aerobic activity like cycling,
                    swimming or brisk walking, combined with
                    half an hour of yogic stretches or light weight training to
                    increase muscle tone.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Also, be watchful of the quantities you eat and how
                    frequently. Normally, short lighter meals, at regular intervals, help maintain uniform blood sugar
                    levels.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">One also needs to avoid feeling stressed and anxious by
                    the health condition. For this, you can practice meditation
                    or inculcate hobbies that bring you in touch with yourself
                    and nature.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Staying calm through any health condition is imperative to
                    managing it better. We at GUUD believe that any circumstance can be overcome with a dash of
                    positivity and
                    sweetness. It is with this reason that we have developed a
                    whole range of wellness sugars that are healthy, filled
                    with natural herbs, and low in calories.</p>
